### Why should I use it? 

Imagine you enjoy playing Severed Steel with music while recording your gameplay. Basicly you'd **open Steam**, **start Severed Steel**, then **start OBS Studio**, then **open AppleMusic**. And what if you play like that every day? 

And now imagine that you can launch all of these with just **one click**. Sound cool, right?

## 📦 Installation

> `SeveredSteel.exe` and `AppleMusic.exe` are elements of sequence "Vibe".

4. Press **Create sequence**.

> [!NOTE]
> It will create `sequences.json`, where will be stored all your sequences. If you will delete all sequences - `sequences.json` will be deleted. It's normal behaviour.
